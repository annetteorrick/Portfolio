## Pizza Place - SQL 
#### 💡 Overview: 
A pizza place wants to determine from their sales information how to better increase net income and find actionable insights for the next year. 

The data I analyzed came from [Maven Analytics Data Playground](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) under "Pizza Place Sales". 

#### 📈 Data Summary: 
A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

#### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Quesitons for Pizza Place Analysis 
1. How many orders do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
